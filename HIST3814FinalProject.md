# Final Project

Ideas for extension:
1. More interactive map?
2. Photos of key scientists/engineers?
3. Download archive of maps
4. Georectify

Steps:
- Create CSV of Locations
- Don't like Town Name as Map identifier. Change to facility name.
- Change Icons of Locations
- Add photos
- Create Posts with detail:
- Formatting issues esp. with images. Found tutorial to help. https://en.support.wordpress.com/images/adding-images-to-posts-or-pages/
- Changing tabs on learn more problem:
- Can't simply have learn more link, must place full URL
- Georectify
- Trying to find maps from National Resources Canada Archive
- Unable to find, use google images instead
- Difficult to find matching georectify control points in North
- Can't get a good screenshot of georectified map, must download as JSON
- Host .json on google drive
- Include image of raw historical map instead
