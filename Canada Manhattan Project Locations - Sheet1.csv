Deline,Northwest Territories,Village of Widows,"The increasing need for uranium to supply nuclear research facilities lead to the First Nation village of Deline, in Northwest Territories. The men of the village would transport bags of uranium from the mines to Fort McMurray, where the uranium would be transported to the Eldorado refinery in Port Hope. Deline became known as the Village of Widows as many of the men began to die of cancer while handling uranium.",http://faroukshaharudin.com/final-project/the-village-of-widows/
Port Radium,Northwest Territories,Eldorado Mines,"Ominously named, Port Radium Mines opened up in 1932 in The Northwest Territories. At the time, Radium was the most expensive material on Earth, but as health concerns proved that the material was lethal, the price of Radium dropped, and the mines were closed in 1940. After being expropriated by the Canadian Government, Radium Mines, now known as Eldorado Mines, were reopened in 1942 to provide Uranium to the American Nuclear Weapons Program.",http://faroukshaharudin.com/final-project/eldorado-mines/
Trail ,British Columbia,Cominco Mine,"With Nuclear reactors relying on the supply of what is known as heavy water, an enriched water mixture that mostly consists of deuterium oxide, the production of heavy water was vital to the success of Nuclear Reactors. Cominco, an American owned company located in Trail, Britich Columbia, produced and supplied Heavy Water to Montréal Laboratory, as well as many other Nuclear Research Facilities, such as the Chicago Pile 3, the World's first Heavy Water Nuclear Reactor. Cominco's role in Canada's Atomic History is little more than providing Heavy Water to Canada, and as such, will not need further details.",N/A
Elliot Lake,Ontario,Elliot Lake Uranium Mines,"Located between Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, the city of Elliot Lake opened 12 uranium mines in a continued effort to research nuclear weapons. The waste from the mines were dumped into ten of the surrounding lakes, contaminating the ten lakes, as well as 90km of the Serpent River.",http://faroukshaharudin.com/final-project/elliot-lake-uranium-mines/
Port Hope,Ontario,Eldorado Refinery,"Port Hope's Eldorado Refinery was built in 1933 to produce radium and uranium. Nearly 100 years later, Port Hope is still feeling the effects of the Eldorado Refinery, as the small town boasts the largest volume of low-level radioactive wastes in Canada.",http://faroukshaharudin.com/final-project/eldorado-refinery/
Deep River,Ontario,Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories,"Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories, located about 180km North-West of Ottawa, was originally developed in 1944 as a less urban rehousing of the Montréal Laboratory. Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories' Zero Energy Experimental Pile Reactor was the first Nuclear Reactor in the World outside of the United States to become operational.",http://faroukshaharudin.com/final-project/chalk-river-nuclear-laboratories/
Montreal,Quebec,Montreal Laboratory,"In colloboration with Britian, the Montréal Laboratory was setup in 1942 to establish Nuclear Research in Canada. Much of Montréal Labratory's Nuclear research was directed towards the Manhatten Project, as the Americans began researching and developing the first atomic weapons.",http://faroukshaharudin.com/final-project/montreal-laboratory/
